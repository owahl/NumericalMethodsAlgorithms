# NumericalMethodsAlgorithms
The NumericalMethodsAlgorthms repositroy contains algorithms created in MECH-105. The algorithms are functions used to solve various problems in Numerical Methods such as calculating zeros using bounding methods, decomposing matrices, and integrating a function using advanced methods.

# Intended Use
These functions are both past assignments for the class MECH-105 and useful resources for future MATLAB coding.

# Using NumericalMethodsAlgorithms Functions
**In code:**
1. Download the repository.
2. Move it to your local MATLAB directory.
3. Type **functionName(input1, input2, ...)** where necessary

**In the command window:**
1. Download the repository.
2. Move it to your local MATLAB directory.
3. Type **[output1, output2, ...] = functionName(input1, input2, ...)** into the command window
